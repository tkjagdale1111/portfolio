    <h2>Machine Learning Projects.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! I am passionate about machine learning and have worked 
        on several exciting projects in this field. My machine learning projects encompass a wide
         range of applications, from image recognition and natural language processing to 
         predictive analytics and anomaly detection. Using state-of-the-art algorithms and 
         techniques, I have developed models that can accurately classify and predict
          outcomes based on complex datasets. Each project showcases my ability to
           leverage data-driven insights to solve real-world problems. I am constantly expanding my
            knowledge and exploring innovative approaches to stay at the forefront of this
             rapidly evolving field. Feel free to explore my projects and see how I harness
              the power of machine learning to drive meaningful results</p>

                techniques to detect and classify faults in the Air Pressure System of
                 a specific application. The objective of this project is to develop an
                  intelligent fault detection system that can accurately identify 
                  abnormal behavior in the Air Pressure System. By leveraging machine
                   learning algorithms, the project aims to analyze sensor data 
                   and provide real-time insights into the system's operational status. </p>
